# Bearcub
_This project was done to practice Angular back in 2018/2019_

Put some of my early Angular learning to use on an actual (front-end only) project while getting the hang of utilizing the Angular Material UI library for all elements.

I like starting projects with the front-end because I find that it quickly uncovers questions and answers around data structure, user flows, and feature expectations while you're mocking it up. I often find myself having to revisit initial UI sketches once I'm actually able to click around and so I utilize a lot of mock data in my projects to help fill out the feeling of the project.

[You can learn more about this project and the decisions I made on my website here](https://stracey.dev/projects/bearcub).

I have an interest in using technology to help people build sustainable businesses that also benefit their communities and so the early notion of wanting to eplore a financial offering for daycare came from looking at the high cost of childcare in the United States.

Despite the high costs to families, facilities themselves are under serious financial strain due to market and regulatory forces that ultimately result in them subsidizing their services through low teacher salaries that make up the bulk of their operating expenses (Averaging $32,000 per employee in California and _just_ $18,200 in Mississippi) with lackluster (if any) benefits. This results in families of childcare workers in the United States being twice as likely to live in poverty (11.8%) than working families in other industries (5.8%) creating a situation where childcare providers are both underpaid and providing a service their clients cannot afford.
