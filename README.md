# Bearcub
_This project was done to practice Angular back in 2018/2019_

Put some of my early Angular learning to use on an actual (front-end only) project while getting the hang of utilizing the Angular Material UI library for all elements.

I like starting projects with the front-end because I find that it quickly uncovers questions and answers around data structure, user flows, and feature expectations while you're mocking it up. I often find myself having to revisit initial UI sketches once I'm actually able to click around and so I utilize a lot of mock data in my projects to help fill out the feeling of the project.

[You can learn more about this project and the decisions I made on my website here](https://stracey.dev/projects/bearcub).

The end user needs for this project were pretty simple and so the intention was to keep the project small enough so that it could be built in 1-2 weekends and allow me to tinker with some frameworks / technologies that I hadn't had the chance to use much yet.

Additionally since the project is mostly just reptitive tables, I wanted to see just how small I could keep the component by having tables dynamically generate there columns and contents based on the model being returned by the API.
